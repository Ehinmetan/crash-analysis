# Introduction
This analysis focuses on understanding the patterns, causes, and impact of airplane crashes across the world. The objective is to uncover insights that answer specific questions on the total number of crashes, their causes, the year and location with the most incidents, and the first recorded crash. These insights can help guide aviation safety improvements, policy recommendations, and risk assessments.

# Problem Statement

The goal of analysing this data is to get insights that answers this question:

1.Total number of crashes with the given period?

2.The first recorded airplane crash?

3.What are the major causes of airplane crashes?

4.Which year did most crashes occur

5.which country and location has the highest numberof crashes?


# DATA sourcing

The data used for this analysis was provided by NG30DaydofLearning,originally gotten from kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurograndi/airplane-crashes-since-1908)


# Data Cleaning

The data set was explored and analyzed to determine the quality of the data.some of the analysis carried out includes:

* Change the date column data type from text to date

*Extract year and month from date column

*Replace empty value

*creating new entries from existing column

*check and change every column to a suitable data type


# Data visualization

After cleaning the data via power query, the data was then imported into Microsoft powerBi to build a dashboard that will help have a clear picture of the major problem

# Insights\Findings

1.Total number of crashes between 1908-2009 was 5236

2.Orville Wrightvin in 1908 during a demonstation flight in Virginia,caused when one of two propellers separated in flight.He sustained serious injuries while the other passengerLTE.selfridge suffered skull damage and later died

3.Weather was the major causes of plane crash,which account for moe than 1600 of the total crashes,followed by Shot, Pilot error, Engine failure, Fire, Structural failure, and Obstacle.

4.1972 was the year with the highest amount of crashes(104).This is also the year with highest fatalities

5.Russia  has the highest number of crashes because they own the aeroflat airline which the operator with most crash

6.Tenerife is the location with most fatalities because of the incident that happen in 1977 when two plane collide

# Conclusion\Recommendation

- Special attention should be given to countries where most crashes has occurred in order to reduce futher occurrences

- Plane crashes are most likely caused by Weather condition,Airline operators should make good use of weather forecast information in planning flight time

- Invest in pilot training and human error reduction, especially under poor weather conditions.

- Improve aircraft engineering and maintenance, particularly for older aircraft models that show up frequently in fatality data.
